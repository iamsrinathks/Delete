**MVP Readiness Overview: Automated Jenkins-to-Harness Migration**

---

## 1. Input Scope  
- **Primary Artifact:** A single, well-formed Jenkinsfile (Declarative or Scripted).  
- **Contextual Constraint:** Reference to one Harness Golden Template variant.  
  > *MVP Boundaries:* Only core pipeline stages (checkout, build, test, deploy) and minimal plugin usage.  

---

## 2. Agent-Driven Migration Flow  

1. **Jenkinsfile Parsing**  
   - **Tool:** AI Migration Agent  
   - **Action:** Ingests the Jenkinsfile, extracts stages, steps, environment settings, and credentials blocks.  

2. **Template Alignment & Mapping**  
   - **Tool:** AI Migration Agent with RAG capability  
   - **Action:** Matches Jenkins constructs to the specified Golden Template’s building blocks—mapping stages to Harness workflows, steps to Harness steps, and environment variables to Harness variables.  
   - **Outcome:** A normalized, in-memory representation of the Jenkins logic, annotated with mapping metadata for traceability and continuous refinement.  

3. **Harness YAML Generation & Schema Validation**  
   - **Tool:** AI Migration Agent  
   - **Action:** Emits a Harness pipeline YAML, then validates it against the Harness schema—identifying structural errors and recommending fixes.  

4. **Output Delivery**  
   - **Artifact:** Validated Harness YAML file  
   - **Supplemental:** Transformation log summarizing mappings, warnings, and agent recommendations.

## 3. Pending Readiness Considerations  
- **Tooling Decisions:** Finalize the parsing library (e.g., Jenkins Pipeline Unit) and RAG framework (e.g., LangChain).  
- **Memory Strategy:** Determine persistence mechanism for mapping “memories” to accelerate subsequent migrations.  
- **Provisioning Scope:** Clarify which migration steps require full agent automation versus lightweight scripts or manual review.  
- **Continuous Improvement:** Establish feedback loop—capture agent performance metrics (accuracy, mapping coverage) to iteratively enhance mapping rules.  

---

## 4. Business Value & Next Steps  
- **Efficiency Gains:** Slash migration effort by automating repetitive translation tasks.  
- **Consistency & Compliance:** Enforce organizational best practices via Golden Template alignment.  
- **Scalable Foundation:** Lay groundwork for bulk migration across hundreds of pipelines.  
- **Pilot Plan:** Select 2–3 representative Jenkinsfiles, run MVP flow, gather stakeholder feedback, refine mappings, then expand rollout.
