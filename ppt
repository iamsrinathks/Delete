Slide 1: Introduction to Pull Requests
ðŸ‘‰ Slide Summary:

What is a PR?
Why PRs are crucial for collaboration.
ðŸ—£ Speaker Notes (Interactive Version):
"Letâ€™s start with a simple question: How many of you have submitted or reviewed a PR before? (Pause for responses)

"For those who have, did you ever find a PR confusing or hard to review? What made it difficult? (Let a few people answer)"

"A Pull Request, or PR, is a way to propose changes to the codebase while allowing others to review and provide feedback before merging. Itâ€™s like asking for a second opinion before making a big decision."

"Now, why do you think good PRs are important? (Pause for responses)

"Thatâ€™s right! Well-structured PRs make reviews easier, prevent bugs, and improve collaboration. Without good PRs, we get messy code, missed issues, and frustrated developers!"

Slide 2: Best Practices Before Raising a PR
ðŸ‘‰ Slide Summary:

Clear branch names.
Meaningful commit messages.
Running linting and tests.
ðŸ—£ Speaker Notes (Interactive Version):
"Before you submit a PR, letâ€™s go through a quick checklist. Whatâ€™s the first thing you should check? (Wait for answers: Branch name, commit message, formatting, etc.)"

"Exactly! First, your branch name should be clear and descriptive. Instead of calling it â€˜fixâ€™ or â€˜update,â€™ use something like feature/PROJ-123-add-loginâ€”this makes it easy to track changes."

"Next, commit messages. Imagine reviewing a PR and seeing the message â€˜Fixed it.â€™ Would you know what was fixed? (Wait for audience reactionâ€”No!) Thatâ€™s why commit messages should be detailed: â€˜Fixed login issue by updating authentication flow.â€™ Much better, right?"

"Lastly, before pushing your code, what should you run? (Wait for responsesâ€”Linting, Tests, etc.) Yes! Always run linting and tests to avoid breaking the build. Nobody wants to be the person who pushes broken code to production!"

Slide 3: Effective Code Review Strategies
ðŸ‘‰ Slide Summary:

Keeping PRs small and focused.
Maintaining a collaborative tone.
Using checklists.
ðŸ—£ Speaker Notes (Interactive Version):
"Imagine you receive a PR with 2,000 lines of code. How do you feel? (Wait for responsesâ€”frustrated, overwhelmed, etc.) Exactly! Thatâ€™s why one of the best practices is to keep PRs small and focused."

"Think about itâ€”whatâ€™s easier? Reviewing 200 lines of code in 15 minutes or digging through 2,000 lines over an hour? (Wait for responses)

"Next, letâ€™s talk about feedback. Have you ever received a harsh or unclear code review? (Pause, let someone share.) How did it feel?"

"Instead of saying â€˜This is wrong,â€™ a better approach is, â€˜Could we refactor this function to improve readability?â€™â€”much better, right?"

"Finally, do you use a checklist when reviewing PRs? (Wait for hands.) If not, think about this: Would a pilot take off without a checklist? Probably not! Checklists help ensure we donâ€™t miss security, readability, or logic issues."


Slide 4: Roles and Responsibilities of PR Reviewers
ðŸ‘‰ Slide Summary:

Reviewer 1â€™s responsibilities.
Reviewer 2â€™s final review.
Importance of constructive feedback.
ðŸ—£ Speaker Notes (Interactive Version):
"Letâ€™s switch rolesâ€”youâ€™re now the reviewer! Imagine you open a PR with vague descriptions, inconsistent formatting, and no tests. What would you do? (Wait for responsesâ€”request changes, ask for clarification, etc.)"

"Exactly! The first reviewer checks the PR title, description, and does a detailed line-by-line review to catch issues early."

"Now, what about the second reviewer? Should they just approve whatever the first reviewer did? (Pause for responses.) Nope! Their job is to double-check everything before approval, ensuring no issues were missed."

"Letâ€™s practice feedback. Suppose you see a hardcoded password in a PRâ€”what do you say? A) â€˜This is bad, fix it.â€™ B) â€˜Consider using environment variables instead of hardcoding credentials.â€™ (Wait for responses)"

"Correct! B is a constructive approach that guides the developer toward best practices instead of just criticizing."

Slide 5: Conclusion & Key Takeaways
ðŸ‘‰ Slide Summary:

Well-documented PRs matter.
Code reviews improve quality.
Constructive feedback builds strong teams.
ðŸ—£ Speaker Notes (Interactive Version):
"Alright, letâ€™s wrap up! Whatâ€™s one thing you learned today about PRs? (Wait for audience responses.)"

"Yes! Well-documented PRs make life easier for everyone. Without proper descriptions and commit messages, even the best code can be misunderstood."

"Whatâ€™s one thing reviewers should always do? (Wait for responses.) Right! Provide constructive feedback instead of just pointing out mistakes. A strong feedback culture leads to better teamwork and higher code quality."

"Final question: Whatâ€™s one action youâ€™ll take after this session to improve your PR process? (Encourage responses: better commit messages, smaller PRs, more feedback, etc.)"

"Great answers! Remember, PRs are not just about codeâ€”theyâ€™re about collaboration, communication, and continuous improvement. Letâ€™s commit to making our PRs clearer, cleaner, and more effective!"
