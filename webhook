To integrate your custom webhook server in GKE with **Dialogflow CX**, you‚Äôll need to make sure it meets Dialogflow‚Äôs webhook requirements and is properly registered in your agent. Here‚Äôs how to do it step by step:

---

### üîó 1. Make Your Webhook Server Dialogflow-Compatible

Dialogflow CX sends a **WebhookRequest** as a JSON payload via HTTPS POST. Your server must:

- Accept HTTPS POST requests
- Parse the incoming JSON payload
- Respond with a valid **WebhookResponse** JSON object

Example response format:

```json
{
  "fulfillment_response": {
    "messages": [
      {
        "text": {
          "text": ["Hello from GKE webhook!"]
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

---

### üåê 2. Expose Your Webhook Server Publicly

Since Dialogflow CX needs to reach your server:

- Use an **Ingress** in GKE to expose the service
- Secure it with **TLS** (HTTPS is mandatory)
- Optionally, use a domain name and configure DNS

---

### üõ°Ô∏è 3. Secure the Endpoint

Dialogflow supports:

- **Authentication headers** (you can configure these in the webhook settings)
- **Custom CA certificates** if needed
- Make sure your server validates incoming requests if required

---

### üß≠ 4. Register the Webhook in Dialogflow CX Console

In the Dialogflow CX console:

1. Go to your agent
2. Click **Webhooks**
3. Click **Create**
4. Enter:
   - Display name
   - Webhook URL (your GKE endpoint)
   - Timeout settings
   - Authentication headers (if needed)
5. Save

You can now use this webhook in **fulfillment** sections of your flows and intents.

---

### üß™ 5. Test It!

Use the Dialogflow CX simulator to trigger the webhook and inspect the response. Make sure:

- The webhook is invoked
- The response is correctly parsed
- The user sees the expected reply
