Imagine you live in a gated community where each resident has access to specific facilities (like the gym, swimming pool, or clubhouse). Traditionally, residents were given physical keys to enter these facilities.
However, keys have problems:
* Keys can be stolen or lost (Security Risk ‚ùå).
* Making a new key every time someone moves in/out is hard (Manual Effort ‚ùå).
* If someone leaves but keeps the key, they still have access (Access Management Issue ‚ùå).
üí° The Solution? Smart Cards (OIDC-based Authentication)!
* Each resident gets a digital ID (like a Smart Card üîë).
* When they want to enter a facility, the system checks their identity dynamically.
* No need to carry or store keys!
This is exactly what OIDC (OpenID Connect) and Workload Identity Federation (WIF) do for GCP authentication in Harness.
Instead of storing long-lived service account keys (physical keys), we issue temporary access dynamically using OIDC (Smart Cards). This improves security, automation, and compliance.

üî∑ OIDC & Workload Identity Federation (WIF) in Less than 10 Points
1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem with Service Account Keys ‚Üí Traditional authentication uses long-lived keys, which can be leaked, hard to manage, and a security risk.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Solution: Workload Identity Federation (WIF) ‚Üí Allows external workloads (Harness, AWS, GitHub, etc.) to authenticate securely without storing keys.

3Ô∏è‚É£ What is OIDC? ‚Üí OpenID Connect (OIDC) is an identity authentication protocol built on OAuth 2.0. that issues JWTs (identity tokens) to verify workloads.

4Ô∏è‚É£ How OIDC Works in WIF? ‚Üí External workloads request an OIDC token (JWT) from their Identity Provider (IdP) and send it to GCP‚Äôs Security Token Service (STS) for verification.

5Ô∏è‚É£ What is Workload Identity Pool? ‚Üí A logical grouping of external identities that need access to GCP (e.g., Dev, Staging, Production environments).

6Ô∏è‚É£ What is a Workload Identity Pool Provider? ‚Üí A bridge between GCP and an external IdP (AWS, GitHub, Okta, etc.), which validates identity claims before granting access.

7Ô∏è‚É£ How Access Tokens are Issued? ‚Üí GCP exchanges the verified JWT for a short-lived OAuth 2.0 access token, which is then used to interact with GCP services.

8Ô∏è‚É£ Why Attribute Mapping? ‚Üí Defines how external IdP attributes (like username, groups) map to GCP IAM roles for access control (e.g., google.subject=assertion.sub).

9Ô∏è‚É£ Key Benefits ‚Üí No static credentials, automatic token rotation, enhanced security, and seamless integration with IAM across multiple IdPs.

üîü Final Outcome ‚Üí External workloads can authenticate dynamically using OIDC, access GCP services securely, and eliminate the need for service account keys.
üöÄ Would you like a Terraform automation script for this setup?


Pipeline runs in Harness ‚Üí Harness generates an OIDC token (JWT).
2Ô∏è‚É£ JWT sent to GCP STS ‚Üí STS validates it against the Workload Identity Pool Provider.
3Ô∏è‚É£ STS issues an OAuth 2.0 Access Token ‚Üí Valid for short duration (e.g., 1 hour).
4Ô∏è‚É£ Pipeline uses the Access Token to interact with Vertex AI, GCS, DataFusion, etc..
